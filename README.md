YaaHamza
========
YaaHamza is an under development reference tool for the Arabic language, developed using Django.
It is designed to have features that are particularly helpful for the Arabic language, much like Chinese-specific website YellowBridge.

Name
----------
The name "YaaHamza" is derived from the last two letters of the Arabic Alphabet (Abjad), Yaa and Hamza.
It could also be interpreted as a call using the Arabic word for "hey" ("yaa") and the Arabic name "Hamza"; in other
words, "Hey Hamza!".
